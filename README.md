Electron with which to interact with spotify connect devices without desktop / mobile app.

I've mainly built this because my spotify desktop app didn't work and wanted to get my keyboard hotkeys working again when I was playing music via spotify connect...

In the meantime I learned about electron and the spotify API, pretty nice :)

Storing it here since it might be useful to see how you can authorize an electron app with Spotify. 

This is very much WIP and trying out how Electron / Spotify API work, I might make this nicer in future though :)
